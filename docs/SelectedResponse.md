# Selected Text Response #

Transcribe provides an option to get responses for selected text, instead of for the complete transcript.

It is best to use this option when continuous responses are disabled, or the continuous response will quickly overwrite the selected response. When **Read Responses Continuously** is enabled, the reply to the selected text will also be spoken automatically.
