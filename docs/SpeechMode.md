# Speech Mode #

Default option in Transcribe is to provide responses as text in the response window.

Use the **Read Responses Continuously** switch to automatically hear every AI response as it is generated. When this is disabled, you can still hear a single response using the **Suggest Response and Read** button shown in the image below. Toggle state is saved so the app remembers your preference.

Continuous Read Aloud helps users with accessibility needs or for handsâ€‘free use.

While audio is being spoken, speaker input capture is temporarily muted to avoid echo. If you speak while a response is playing, playback stops immediately so your words are transcribed.
To fully eliminate echo, capture resumes only after a brief delay and any input matching the last spoken response within one second is ignored.

If audio playback fails, ensure your speakers are enabled and `ffplay` from FFmpeg is installed and on your PATH.
