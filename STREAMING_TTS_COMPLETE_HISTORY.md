# Complete Streaming TTS Debug History

## Timeline of Attempts and Results

### Initial Problem (January 14, 2025)
- **Issue**: TTS reads response only AFTER visual text is fully shown (3-4 second delay)
- **Working**: Voice filtering at 99% accuracy
- **Goal**: Make TTS streaming work with <300ms latency

### Attempt 1: Basic Streaming Implementation
**What was done:**
- Created `streaming_tts.py` with OpenAI TTS support
- Created `audio_player_streaming.py` with queue-based playback
- Updated `gpt_responder.py` with sentence detection

**Result**: ❌ Still not streaming - audio plays after visual response completes

### Attempt 2: Fix Sentence Detection
**What was done:**
- Changed regex from `r"[.!?]\s*"` to `r"[.!?]\s"` (requires space)
- Process first match immediately instead of last match
- Force break at 42 chars without punctuation
- Changed `tts_provider` from `gtts` to `openai`

**Result**: ❌ Audio still plays after response, not during

### Attempt 3: Debug Missing Dependencies
**What was done:**
- Discovered PyAudio, OpenAI, and GTTS modules not installed
- Created `install_streaming_tts_windows.bat` script
- User ran installation on Windows

**Result**: ❌ Same issue persists after installation

### Attempt 4: Deep Configuration Analysis
**What was done:**
- Added extensive `[TTS Debug]` logging throughout
- Found `global_vars_module.config` wasn't set
- Old TTS system (non-streaming) was playing after response

**Fix applied:**
- Store config in `global_vars` in `main.py`
- Check `responder.tts_enabled` directly in `appui.py`

**Result**: ✅ Partial success - new TTS voice confirmed (female voice), but still not streaming

### Attempt 5: OpenAI True Streaming (Other AI Recommendation)
**What was done:**
- Added `stream=True` parameter to OpenAI TTS API
- Increased audio queue from 20 to 100
- Added `sent_q.join()` and `task_done()` for queue sync
- Increased `tts_min_sentence_chars` from 10 to 40

**Result**: ❌ No audio at all! Second colleague gets no response

### Attempt 6: Fix Iterator Issue (Latest)
**Root cause found:**
- OpenAI streaming returns `AudioResponseChunk` objects, not bytes
- Audio player silently drops non-bytes chunks
- `sent_q.join()` blocks forever without `task_done()`

**Fix applied:**
- Use `resp.iter_bytes()` instead of raw iterator
- Keep `task_done()` calls (already implemented)
- Add bytes validation in audio player
- Reduce `tts_min_sentence_chars` to 20

**Expected result**: Audio should work for all colleagues

## Key Learnings

### What Works:
1. Voice filtering - 99% accuracy confirmed
2. OpenAI TTS provider (female voice active)
3. Basic streaming infrastructure in place
4. Queue-based audio playback architecture

### What Didn't Work:
1. GTTS provider - no true streaming support
2. Waiting for complete response - old TTS system override
3. Direct iterator on streaming response - returns objects not bytes
4. High min_sentence_chars (40) - delays audio too much

### Critical Fixes That Made a Difference:
1. Storing config in global_vars
2. Using `resp.iter_bytes()` for raw audio bytes
3. Proper queue synchronization with `task_done()`
4. Windows-specific audio device detection

## Current State (as of last push)
- All infrastructure for streaming TTS is in place
- Iterator issue fixed (uses `iter_bytes()`)
- Queue synchronization implemented
- Audio player validates byte chunks
- Waiting for user test results
