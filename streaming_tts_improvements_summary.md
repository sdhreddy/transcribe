# Streaming TTS Improvements Applied

## Summary of Changes

All 5 recommended improvements have been successfully implemented to enable true streaming TTS with OpenAI:

### 1. ✅ True OpenAI Streaming (streaming_tts.py)
- Added `stream=True` parameter to OpenAI TTS API call
- Now uses server-side streaming for immediate audio chunks
- Removed pseudo-streaming code that was causing delays

### 2. ✅ Increased Audio Queue (audio_player_streaming.py)
- Increased queue size from 20 to 100 items
- Added overflow warning: `[TTS] queue full – dropping audio chunk`
- Prevents blocking on long responses

### 3. ✅ TTS Queue Completion (gpt_responder.py)
- Added `self.sent_q.join()` after flushing TTS buffer
- Added `self.sent_q.task_done()` in TTS worker
- Ensures all audio plays before response completes

### 4. ✅ Optimized Sentence Length (parameters.yaml)
- Changed `tts_min_sentence_chars` from 10 to 40
- Reduces micro-sentence requests
- Improves streaming performance

### 5. ✅ Latency Test Created (test_tts_latency.py)
- Quick test to verify first-chunk latency
- Expected: <250ms with true streaming
- Shows chunk count and total streaming time

## Expected Results

With these improvements, you should see:

1. **Console Output:**
```
[GPT] Token received: 'Hello' ...
[TTS] Sentence detected: 'Hello, how can I assist you today?'
[TTS] First audio chunk received in 180ms
[TTS] TTS completed: 42 chunks in 780ms
```

2. **User Experience:**
- Visual text appears token-by-token
- Audio starts <300ms after first sentence completes
- Continuous playback without gaps
- No early cut-offs or mid-sentence drops

3. **Performance:**
- Eliminates 2-4 second pause before audio
- True streaming from OpenAI servers
- Smooth, natural conversation flow

## Testing on Windows

To verify the improvements:

1. Pull the latest changes
2. Ensure OpenAI API key is in override.yaml
3. Run the application
4. Watch for `[TTS Debug]` messages in console
5. Audio should start within 300ms of first sentence

The improvements transform the TTS from buffered playback to true streaming, providing a much more responsive conversational experience.
