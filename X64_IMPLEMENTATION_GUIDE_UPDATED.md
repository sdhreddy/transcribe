# x64 Windows Transcribe App Implementation Guide (Updated)
**Updated**: June 12, 2025  
**Based on**: Successful ARM64 branch enhancements

## Overview
This guide includes ALL enhancements from the ARM64 branch that are applicable to x64 Windows systems.

## Major Enhancements to Implement

### 1. Voice Discrimination with Inverted Logic ✨ NEW
**Purpose**: AI responds only to colleagues, not to primary user  
**Technology**: Pyannote speaker embeddings for accurate voice identification

#### Files to Add/Modify:
1. **Add** `app/transcribe/voice_filter.py` (complete implementation)
2. **Modify** `app/transcribe/audio_transcriber.py`
3. **Modify** `app/transcribe/parameters.yaml`
4. **Add** voice enrollment and testing scripts

#### Key Implementation Steps:
```python
# 1. Install pyannote dependencies
pip install pyannote.audio speechbrain

# 2. Add to parameters.yaml:
voice_filter_enabled: Yes
voice_filter_profile: my_voice.npy
voice_filter_threshold: 0.25
inverted_voice_response: Yes

# 3. Create voice enrollment script
# 4. Integrate VoiceFilter into audio pipeline
```

### 2. Fix Audio Accumulation Bug ✨ NEW
**Issue**: Audio was being accumulated twice, corrupting voice data  
**Fix**: Remove duplicate accumulation in `_update_last_sample_and_phrase_status`

```python
# In audio_transcriber.py, ensure accumulation happens only once:
if source_info["last_spoken"] and time_spoken - source_info["last_spoken"] \
        > datetime.timedelta(seconds=PHRASE_TIMEOUT):
    source_info["last_sample"] = data  # Start fresh
    source_info["new_phrase"] = True
else:
    source_info["last_sample"] += data  # Accumulate
    source_info["new_phrase"] = False
# DO NOT accumulate again after this block!
```

### 3. Remove Microphone Muting During TTS ✨ ENHANCED
**Previous**: Microphone was muted during TTS playback  
**New**: Keep microphone active for natural conversation flow

In `audio_player.py`, update the Windows TTS method:
```python
def _play_with_windows_tts(self, speech: str, speed_val: int = 0):
    """Windows-native TTS without muting microphone"""
    import subprocess
    
    # Remove all set_device calls that switch audio input
    # Just play the audio without touching microphone state
    
    ps_command = [
        'powershell.exe', '-Command',
        f'Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech; '
        f'$synth = New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer; '
        f'$synth.Rate = {speed_val}; '
        f'$synth.Speak("{safe_speech}"); '
        f'$synth.Dispose()'
    ]
    
    subprocess.run(ps_command, check=True, capture_output=True)
```

### 4. Enhanced GPT Response Handling ✨ ENHANCED
**Improvements**:
- Better accumulated response handling
- Proper response tracking for relay detection
- Reduced streaming update frequency

In `gpt_responder.py`:
```python
def get_merged_conversation_response_latest_only(self, text_to_send):
    """Get only the latest speaker's messages, not accumulated"""
    messages = []
    last_role = None
    
    for conv in self.conversation.get_dict()['conversation'][-20:]:
        if conv['role'] == last_role and conv['role'] == 'user':
            # Skip if same user continues speaking
            continue
        messages.append({'role': conv['role'], 'content': conv['content']})
        last_role = conv['role']
    
    return messages
```

### 5. Audio Queue Management ✨ NEW
**Issue**: Audio queue backs up during TTS playback  
**Fix**: Aggressive queue draining for speaker audio

In `audio_transcriber.py`:
```python
# Enhanced queue monitoring
if queue_size > 5:
    logger.warning(f"Audio queue severely backed up: {queue_size} items")
    # Drain old speaker audio aggressively
    # Keep only recent microphone audio (last 5 seconds)
```

### 6. Improved Voice Filter Integration ✨ NEW
Complete voice filter integration with proper error handling:
- HuggingFace token management
- Fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced logging
- Proper audio format conversion

- [ ] Generate voice-print successfully
- [ ] Test with primary user voice → No response
- [ ] Test with colleague voices → Get responses
- [ ] Test with both male and female colleagues

### Phase 3: Performance
- [ ] Response time < 3 seconds
- [ ] No audio queue backups
- [ ] Smooth conversation flow
- [ ] Voice discrimination accuracy > 95%

### Phase 4: Edge Cases
- [ ] Short utterances handled correctly
- [ ] Long conversations don't accumulate
- [ ] Multiple speakers in sequence
- [ ] Background noise handling

## Configuration Template

```yaml
# parameters.yaml additions

  voice_filter_profile: my_voice.npy
  voice_filter_threshold: 0.25
  
  # Keep existing settings

# 1. Install voice filter dependencies
pip install pyannote.audio speechbrain torch torchaudio

# 2. Set up HuggingFace token (required for pyannote)
# Get token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
echo "YOUR_HF_TOKEN" > ~/.huggingface_token

# 3. Create voice samples directory
mkdir saved_voice_recordings

# 4. Run voice enrollment (after implementing)
python scripts/make_voiceprint.py

# 5. Test voice filter
python test_voice_filter_basic.py
```

## Key Differences from ARM64

### What to SKIP (ARM64-specific):
1. WSL2 audio fixes
2. ALSA configuration
3. PulseAudio workarounds
4. espeak installation (use Windows TTS)

### What to KEEP (Universal enhancements):
1. ✅ Voice discrimination with pyannote
2. ✅ Inverted logic implementation
3. ✅ Audio accumulation fix
4. ✅ No microphone muting
5. ✅ Enhanced GPT response handling
6. ✅ Queue management improvements


## Expected Results

### Before:
- 30+ second TTS delays
- Everyone triggers AI responses
- Microphone muted during playback
- Audio queue backlogs

### After:
- <1 second TTS response
- Only colleagues trigger responses
- Natural conversation flow
- Stable performance
- 100% voice discrimination accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **PyAudio not found**: Install with `pip install pyaudio`
2. **HuggingFace token error**: Save token to `~/.huggingface_token`
3. **Voice not recognized**: Regenerate voice-print with better samples
4. **TTS not working**: Check PowerShell execution policy

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Test voice filter
python -c "from app.transcribe.voice_filter import VoiceFilter; print('OK')"

# Check audio devices
python -c "import pyaudio; p = pyaudio.PyAudio(); print(p.get_device_count())"

# Test TTS
powershell -Command "Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech; (New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer).Speak('Test')"
```

## Support Files

All implementation files from ARM64 branch are compatible with x64:
- `voice_filter.py` - Complete implementation
- `scripts/` directory - All enrollment and tuning scripts
- Test files - All voice filter tests
- Monitor scripts - Performance monitoring

## Final Notes

1. **Start with voice enrollment** - Critical for discrimination
2. **Test incrementally** - One enhancement at a time
3. **Keep the threshold at 0.25** - Proven to work well
4. **Use the monitoring tools** - Real-time debugging
5. **Backup before changes** - Easy rollback if needed

The x64 implementation should be easier than ARM64 since you have native Windows audio support. All enhancements are production-tested and working perfectly on the ARM64 branch.
